# Louise’s Kickstarter Analysis

The purpose of the analysis was to analyze data pertaining to Kickstarter launch dates of the theater genre. Specifically “plays” and their relationship to outcomes based on goals and their success rate, to give our client Louise a more measured and visual insight. 
To do so, we have primarily focused on two data sheets, one of which contain the “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date” and the other which provide the statistics of the “Outcomes Based on Goals”.

### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

In the first data sheet, Louise, can see as displayed on the chart that plays launched in May have the most number of success with 93 followed by June and July with 83, and 75. Unfortunately, for December, the month has the lowest number of successful plays launched with 27 followed by January, March and November. By this data, Louise may determine that a greater number of plays launched during the months of May, June, July have a higher percentage of success as opposed to November, December, January, and March which have the lowest number of successful plays launched. 

As I have also included in the data chart, a breakdown of percentages which we can now also see that although, May has the highest number of successful plays, June has the highest percentage of success with 70.34%. Louise can also determine from our data chart and graph, that December would be the least ideal month to launch her play with the lowest success rate of 48.21%. She can also determine from the data we have collected in the chart, that the peak number of successful plays launched is in May and June with the number declining following the months after. 

### Outcomes Based on Goals

In our second data sheet, we break down the percentages of successful, failed and canceled outcomes based on goals with a statistical chart and line graph. According to the data we gathered from our chart, our statistical analysis shows plays which have a goal of under $1000 have the highest success rate at 71.08%, with the second highest percentage of 66.01% success rate coming from plays with a goal in the range of $1000-$4999. From the data collected, we can also see that the highest number of plays are within this range as well. This would be useful information for our client since she is looking for a goal of $4000. 


### Possible Add-Ons

Some other possible tables and graphs that we could of created would be, a Percentage of success for theater outcome launch dates on the first data sheet. This would help Louise see in percentages her changes of success and failure immediately. 
Also, total values for the “outcomes based on goals” and percentage of averages of “outcomes based on goals” located in the second data sheet. I would also suggest our graphs have data values along with the markers as well as shown in the second version of the graph image included in the resources folder. I believe this would help our client visually see the trend along with the value more clearly. 

### Limitations

I believe the limitations with this data sheet is that although there is an abundant amount of data, some of the percentages of success and failure are very close together. This may be a sign that the data may need to be more specific so that our client can make more measured decisions with our data points. Also, although they show the number of plays, there is a lack of specificity with the type of plays as well. This may make our data less accurate. 

### Conclusion

As a closing, we have provided Louise, with a data analysis to help her gauge on the optimal month to launch her play as well as the optimal goal which have the highest success rate. We have shown her in percentage breakdowns in our charts as well as our graphs to visually display the trends and values of the information pertaining to her Kickstarter venture in theater.
